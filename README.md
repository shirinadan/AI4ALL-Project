>**Predicting Startup Success with AI Supervision**  

## 🌟 Overview  
**Bizlens** is an AI-driven project developed during the AI4ALL 2025 program to explore whether machine learning can help forecast the success of early-stage startups. Using supervised learning and feature engineering, we built a model that analyzes key indicators from startup data to generate a **Success Probability Score** — a metric that can guide founders, investors, and incubators.



## 🔍 Key Features  

- **Startup Input Form**  
  Enter key information about your startup — funding stage, industry, team size, and more.

- **Instant Success Prediction**  
  Receive a real-time success probability score based on your inputs.

- **Insightful Feedback Summary**  
  View a personalized summary that highlights strengths, potential red flags, and strategic tips.
  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub  
- **Methods**: Supervised learning, feature selection, model evaluation



## 📈 Results Snapshot  
> We employed a supervised learning approach using the RandomForestRegressor. This method allowed us to analyze the relationship between various features and their predictive power regarding startup success.

**Our Random Forest Regression model achieved an R² score of 0.6826, indicating it explains about 68% of the variance in startup success scores. 
The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is 0.0565, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is 0.0380, reflecting a good predictive accuracy with minimal deviation from true values.**



## 🧩 Challenges  
- Class imbalance in success labels  
- Noisy data across industries  
- Weak correlations required creative features  
- Success is subjective — prediction ≠ guarantee
