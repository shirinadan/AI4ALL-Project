# Bizlens: Startup Success Evaluation

> A machine learning project to predict early-stage startup success scores based on funding, founding data, and industry insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Bizlens is an ML-powered tool that estimates the success potential of startups using a regression model trained on global startup investment data. The goal is to assist entrepreneurs in evaluating their business positioning through explainable, data-driven predictions.

This project was developed as part of an AI/ML learning program focused on building real-world, responsible AI systems.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – data preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – model development (Random Forest)  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – EDA and visualizations
- **Flask** - Back-end fetching data for model
- **React** - Front-end UI for web app

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source**: Startup Investments (Crunchbase) on kaggle
- **Size**: ~9,000 entries  
- **Features**: 30 total → reduced to 15 through correlation analysis  
- **Filtered**: Startups founded latest 2014  
- **Label**: Custom success score (details below)

## 🔄 Label Design

We initially received a “success score” from the dataset, but:

- It was noisy and lacked transparency  
- We attempted to **engineer our own success formula**, but the model just memorized it  
- Final approach:
  - Defined success using 2–3 key features (e.g., total funding, acquisition status)  
  - **Removed those features from training** to prevent data leakage  
  - Result: The model infers success based on **other patterns**, not direct labels

## 🔍 Feature Importance

Top predictive features include:
- Number of funding rounds  
- Industry category  
- Founding year  
- Team size estimates

*We used feature importance plots to identify top drivers of success predictions.*

## 🧪 Ethical & Fairness Considerations

- **Survivorship Bias**: Most failed startups are excluded from the dataset  
- **Timeline Gaps**: Post-2014 startups are not included
- **Nuanced Success Factors**: Our definition of “success” is based on a few features and may vary across regions or industries.

## 📈 Future Work

- 📡 Add updated and post-2014 data  
- 💬 Incorporate qualitative factors (e.g., founder background, pitch tone)  
- 🔍 Evaluate fairness across gender, region, and underrepresented founder groups
